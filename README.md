# Seam-Carving-Prototype-Content-aware-Image-Resizer
Implemented a 2-pass Seam Carver algorithm with dynamic programming in Java. The first pass crawled pixels in the image to identify seams of pixels with the least deviation from neighboring pixels. The second pass collapsed seams and resized the image with minimal modification.
